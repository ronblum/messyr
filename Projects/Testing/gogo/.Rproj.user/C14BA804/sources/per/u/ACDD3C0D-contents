## R Markdown

## This is an R **M**ark**down document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for author**ing HTML, P`DF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown`*see [http://rmarkdown.rstudi`o.com`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com){.uri}`.`*

-   *`When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any em`bedded R* code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

> ## Including Plots😚\\

1.  You can also embed plots, for example:

2.  

> ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
> plot(pressure)
> ```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.😝

**`x <- c(1, 2, 3)`**
